# SP5rals
A P5.js representation of M.C. Escher's artwork "Spirals"

## About 
This project started as a class asignment. Initially, the objetive was to create a visual effect using P5.js library, with the limitation of a maximum 1024 characters for the main and only script. I chose the goal of recreating M.C. Escher artwork "Spirals", as it posed a decent challenge and was suitable for being animated into a mesmerizing effect.

### Original work by M.C. Escher

## The Spirals
The first part of the project consisted in analysing the artwork itself. It clearly involves some spirals... but which ones? 

It can be easily apreciated how the stripes that form the structure follow a circular path in space, but also twist around this path at an ever increasing distance, resulting in the effect of the convoluted stripes "eating" their tails. This is somehow similar to a torus whose minor radius grows exponentially, the key being the rate of that growth. Because Escher was both a skilled mathematician and an artist at the same time, one could be tempted to try, at first, with a well known mathematical concept that have served multiple artists since ancient times: the golden proportions, i.e the Fibonacci spiral.
